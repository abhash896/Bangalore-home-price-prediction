# Bangalore-home-price-prediction

This project was aimed at predicting the home prices in the city of Bangalore at varying locations using different machine learning models namely:
* Linear Regression
* Lasso Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Decision Tree

It was observed that Linear regression and Ridge regression came out to be almost similar with an R2 score of about 0.82. Thus, linear regression was chosen and the whole machine learning model was deployed on the cloud via heroku.

The link of the deployed app on heroku is mentioned below:
